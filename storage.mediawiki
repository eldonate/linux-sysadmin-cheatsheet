=== Create Swap File ===
swapoff -a #this will clear the swap and actually turn it off
fallocate -l 3G /swapfile #this creates a file of 3GB to use it as swap
chmod 600 /swapfile #set correct permisions
mkswap /swapfile #set the swap file
The we need to edit /etc/fstab to set the swapfile name
swapon -a #turns the swap on again
